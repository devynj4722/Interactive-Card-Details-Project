# Interactive Card Details Project

FEM.io project using js html and css

This is my first full HTML CSS JS project completed all by myself. I learned alot from this process, styling a responsive form and using JS to update card content and display error messages. Not as perfect as I want it to be css was the most challenging part. I had to get creative to make the css work even though their proabably a better way to make the css than what I did.
